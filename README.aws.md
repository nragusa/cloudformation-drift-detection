## CloudFormation Drift Detection

This is a sample application which will update the [Drift Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/detect-drift-stack.html) 
status across all stacks within a given region. The status will be updated
automatically on a daily basis. You can view the status of drift by viewing
your CloudFormation stacks in the console.
